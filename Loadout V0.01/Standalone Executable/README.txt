Nuclear Throne Loadout Interface V0.01
Made by: Tacobandit

How to use this thing:

1) Make a backup of your old save. Make sure cloud saving is disabled.

2) Either copy your old save to the Folder with the .exe and name it "oldSave.sav", or create a text document, copy your save text into it, and rename it "oldSave.sav".

3) Create a new text file in the same folder as the .exe. Rename it "nuclearthrone.sav". Do not do anything to this file. If you cannot change the extension, you will need to go to Control Panel > Appearance and Personalization > Show hidden files and folders (under Folder Options), then uncheck the box that says "Hide extensions for known file types".

4) Run the .exe. Follow the steps. It has no exception handling, but it shouldn't crash should you not actually follow the instructions.

5) If you did everything correctly, the "nuclearthrone.sav" file now has the modified weapon for that character. Now just move that file to your nuclearthrone save location in AppData.

It's very basic. It's probably not even worth using in it's current state. This is just proof of concept.

I have attached two sample files in case you do not want to risk your save file.

Planned Changes:

- Allow the user to modify multiple character weapons in a single run of the .exe

- Allow the user to add crowns to characters.

- Automatically write the save file to the AppData location(?)
